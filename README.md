# Apo's Boss Markers

This is a marker pack for the Pathing module, aiming to provide useful markers for several boss encounters in Guild Wars 2

## Installation

Download the latest .taco file from [Releases](https://github.com/ApocalypseGW2/apo-markers/releases) and place it in the `markers` folder for Pathing. Nothing else required

## Content

Right now, this pack only features markers for Kela (normal mode - possibly also challenge mode depending on mechanic changes).

It shows:

- numbered crab spawns
- stacking spot to reach all crabs in 1500 range
- wave trigger area lines

More encounters planned for the future
